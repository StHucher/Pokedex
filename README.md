This an exercice using a MVC model. I created an application that lists pokemon. By clicking on an animal, it allows to have details on this one. By choosing a particular type of Pokemon (fire, water...), we obtain the list of pokemons. associates

I imported: `pokedex.sql` to create my database on MariaDB.
